                    <h1> Nihal Naqvi </h1>
                    <p> I am currently a student attending Queen's University, studying chemical engineering. I am currently in my third year of school.</p>
                    <p> I enjoy travelling extensively, hence had to miss the first class as I was in the Middle East during that time.</p>
                    <p> I am deeply passionate about cars as well and enjoy taking my car to the track as well on occasion.</p>
                    <p>I decided to take this class as there is a large aspect to coding in engineering, specifically chemical engineering. I have previously learnt Robot-C language and have started to teach myself Python. I plan to use coding to my advantage in order to open up various opportunities for myself.</p>
                    <p> I enjoy a variety of different sports and often never fail to keep myself active. Some sports that I enjoy are skiing, volleyball, swimming, tennis and golf. I work as a ski instructor and coach in the winter during my breaks and working on achieving my PPL (Private Pilots License) this summer as well. </p>
